    <h2>Model</h2>
    <pre>Empty array in constructor to hold differnt Categories
        <em>Add Categories</em>
        This creates a category and adds it to the list.
        <em>Remove Categories</em>
        This removes a category from the list.
    </pre>
    <h2>Category</h2>
    <pre>The constructor holds things like
        the color
        the name
        an array of items for that category
        the budget for that category
        and the total expenses so far for that category

        Then we have methods that return budget - total expenses
        methods that add or remove expense items
        and a method that allows you to change your budget
    </pre>
    <h2>List items</h2>
    <pre>
            the constructor holds a place for 
            a date
            a description
            a payment type 
            and an amount

            I cannot currently think of any methods I need for my expense items
        </pre>
