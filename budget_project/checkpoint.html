    <h1>Features Added
    </h1>
    <p>So far I've been able to implement quite a few features.<br> I've been able to </p>
    <ul>
        <li>update budget by typing into budget window. This submits when you click off of the item</li>
        <li>I've been able to have the expenses for a category added up and then displayed in the spent window</li>
        <li>I've made it possible to add items to a category by typing them into the tracker then hitting 'add new'</li>
        <li>Implemented the logic behind switching categories and having the colors change aswell as items</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What I still need to do</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>I have yet to add a delete button for the items aswell as the functionality to edit each item</li>
        <li>I have not yet made it possible to create a category. I plan to do this through a popup window</li>
        <li>I have not yet vetted data types for input. Ex. only numbers added to amount</li>
    </ul>
